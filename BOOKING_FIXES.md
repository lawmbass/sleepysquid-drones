# Booking Submission Fixes

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. Rate Limiting Too Restrictive
**Problem**: The booking rate limit was set to only 3 attempts per 15 minutes per IP, which was too restrictive and was causing legitimate users to be blocked.

**Fix**: 
- Increased the rate limit from 3 to 10 attempts per 15 minutes
- Added better logging to track rate limit hits
- Ensured successful requests don't count towards the limit

### 2. Missing Error Handling for Rate Limits
**Problem**: When rate limiting was triggered, the frontend wasn't properly handling the specific error response.

**Fix**:
- Added specific error handling for rate limit errors in the frontend
- Added proper reCAPTCHA reset on rate limit errors
- Improved error messages to include guidance for users

### 3. Network Error Handling
**Problem**: Network errors and timeouts weren't properly handled, leaving users without feedback.

**Fix**:
- Added 30-second timeout to booking requests
- Improved error messages for different types of network errors
- Added proper reCAPTCHA reset on network errors

### 4. Date Validation Mismatch
**Problem**: Frontend allowed bookings 2 days in advance but backend required 7 days, causing validation errors.

**Fix**:
- Updated backend validation to match frontend (2 days minimum)
- Consistent validation messages

### 5. Improved Logging and Debugging
**Problem**: Insufficient logging made it difficult to debug submission issues.

**Fix**:
- Added comprehensive logging throughout the booking process
- Added debug logging in frontend for troubleshooting
- Better error tracking for API responses

### 6. Enhanced User Feedback
**Problem**: Users weren't getting clear feedback about submission status and errors.

**Fix**:
- Added visual error indicators with icons
- Improved error message clarity
- Better loading states during submission

## Files Modified

1. `libs/rateLimit.js` - Updated rate limiting configuration
2. `components/home/BookingSection.jsx` - Enhanced error handling and user feedback
3. `pages/api/bookings.js` - Improved logging and date validation

## Testing

To test the booking functionality:
1. Navigate to the booking section on the homepage
2. Fill out the form with valid data
3. Ensure the date is at least 2 days in the future
4. Complete the reCAPTCHA
5. Submit the form

The system should now:
- Provide clear error messages if something goes wrong
- Handle network issues gracefully
- Allow reasonable retry attempts
- Give proper feedback during submission

## Environment Requirements

Ensure these environment variables are set:
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_RECAPTCHA_SITE_KEY` - reCAPTCHA site key
- `RECAPTCHA_SECRET_KEY` - reCAPTCHA secret key
- MongoDB connection configured
- Email service configured (optional but recommended)

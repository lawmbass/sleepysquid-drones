# Booking Submission Fixes

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. Missing Environment Configuration (CRITICAL)
**Problem**: The application was missing the `.env` file with MongoDB connection string and other required environment variables, causing database connection timeouts.

**Fix**: 
- Created `.env` file with proper MongoDB URI and other required variables
- Added comprehensive MongoDB connection error handling
- Added database health check endpoint at `/api/health/database`

### 2. MongoDB Connection Critical Bug Fix
**Problem**: The `connectMongo` function had two critical issues:
- **Inconsistent Return Types**: Returned different types (Connection object, Promise<Connection>, Promise<Mongoose>) depending on connection state
- **Hanging Promise**: Promise for connecting state only listened for 'connected' and 'error' events, missing 'disconnected' events, causing indefinite hangs

**Fix**:
- **Consistent Return Types**: Always returns the connection object for predictable behavior
- **Comprehensive Event Handling**: Added 'disconnected' event listener and timeout protection
- **Promise Caching**: Implemented singleton pattern to prevent multiple concurrent connection attempts
- **Proper Cleanup**: Added event listener cleanup and connection state reset on errors
- **Timeout Protection**: Added 15-second timeout to prevent hanging promises

### 3. Rate Limiting Too Restrictive
**Problem**: The booking rate limit was set to only 3 attempts per 15 minutes per IP, which was too restrictive and was causing legitimate users to be blocked.

**Fix**: 
- Increased the rate limit from 3 to 10 attempts per 15 minutes
- Added better logging to track rate limit hits
- Ensured successful requests don't count towards the limit

### 4. Missing Error Handling for Rate Limits
**Problem**: When rate limiting was triggered, the frontend wasn't properly handling the specific error response.

**Fix**:
- Added specific error handling for rate limit errors in the frontend
- Added proper reCAPTCHA reset on rate limit errors
- Improved error messages to include guidance for users

### 5. Network Error Handling
**Problem**: Network errors and timeouts weren't properly handled, leaving users without feedback.

**Fix**:
- Added 30-second timeout to booking requests
- Improved error messages for different types of network errors
- Added proper reCAPTCHA reset on network errors

### 6. Date Validation Mismatch
**Problem**: Frontend allowed bookings 2 days in advance but backend required 7 days, causing validation errors.

**Fix**:
- Updated backend validation to match frontend (2 days minimum)
- Consistent validation messages

### 7. Improved Logging and Debugging
**Problem**: Insufficient logging made it difficult to debug submission issues.

**Fix**:
- Added comprehensive logging throughout the booking process
- Added debug logging in frontend for troubleshooting
- Better error tracking for API responses

### 8. Enhanced User Feedback
**Problem**: Users weren't getting clear feedback about submission status and errors.

**Fix**:
- Added visual error indicators with icons
- Improved error message clarity
- Better loading states during submission

## Files Modified

1. `.env` - **CREATED** - Essential environment configuration
2. `libs/mongoose.js` - Enhanced MongoDB connection handling with timeouts and retries
3. `libs/rateLimit.js` - Updated rate limiting configuration
4. `components/home/BookingSection.jsx` - Enhanced error handling and user feedback
5. `pages/api/bookings.js` - Improved logging, date validation, and database error handling
6. `pages/api/health/database.js` - **CREATED** - Database health check endpoint

## Testing

To test the booking functionality:
1. Navigate to the booking section on the homepage
2. Fill out the form with valid data
3. Ensure the date is at least 2 days in the future
4. Complete the reCAPTCHA
5. Submit the form

The system should now:
- Provide clear error messages if something goes wrong
- Handle network issues gracefully
- Allow reasonable retry attempts
- Give proper feedback during submission

## Environment Requirements

**CRITICAL**: A `.env` file has been created with placeholder values. You must update it with real values:

### Required for basic functionality:
- `MONGODB_URI` - Your MongoDB connection string (local or Atlas)
- `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` - A secure random string for session encryption

### Required for booking form:
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_RECAPTCHA_SITE_KEY` - reCAPTCHA site key (get from Google reCAPTCHA)
- `RECAPTCHA_SECRET_KEY` - reCAPTCHA secret key

### Optional but recommended:
- `MAILGUN_API_KEY` - For email notifications
- `ADMIN_EMAILS` - Admin email addresses
- `GOOGLE_ID` and `GOOGLE_SECRET` - For Google OAuth login

### Setup Instructions:
1. **MongoDB**: Set up a local MongoDB instance or use MongoDB Atlas
2. **reCAPTCHA**: Get keys from https://www.google.com/recaptcha/admin
3. **Update .env**: Replace placeholder values with real credentials
4. **Restart server**: After updating .env, restart the development server

### Testing Database Connection:
Visit `/api/health/database` to check if MongoDB is properly connected.

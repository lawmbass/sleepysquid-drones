# User Deletion Improvements

## Overview
This document outlines the improvements made to the user deletion functionality in the SleepySquid Drones application to address two key issues:

1. **Accounts Collection Cleanup**: NextAuth accounts weren't being cleaned up when users were deleted
2. **Confirmation Dialog**: Added a proper confirmation dialog before deleting users

## Changes Made

### 1. Backend API Improvements (`pages/api/admin/users/[id].js`)

**Problem**: When deleting a user, only the User document was removed from the database, but related NextAuth collections (accounts, sessions, verification_tokens) were left behind as orphaned data.

**Solution**: Updated the `handleDeleteUser` function to clean up all related collections:

```javascript
// Clean up related NextAuth collections
try {
  // Delete from accounts collection (OAuth provider accounts)
  await mongoose.connection.collection('accounts').deleteMany({ 
    userId: user._id 
  });
  
  // Delete from sessions collection
  await mongoose.connection.collection('sessions').deleteMany({ 
    userId: user._id 
  });
  
  // Delete from verification_tokens collection if any
  await mongoose.connection.collection('verification_tokens').deleteMany({ 
    identifier: user.email 
  });

  console.log(`Cleaned up NextAuth collections for user ${user.email}`);
} catch (cleanupError) {
  console.error('Error cleaning up NextAuth collections:', cleanupError);
  // Continue with user deletion even if cleanup fails
}
```

**Benefits**:
- Prevents orphaned data in the database
- Maintains data integrity
- Ensures proper cleanup of OAuth provider accounts
- Graceful error handling - user deletion continues even if cleanup fails

### 2. Frontend Confirmation Dialog (`components/admin/UsersList.jsx`)

**Problem**: Users were deleted immediately without confirmation, which could lead to accidental deletions.

**Solution**: 
1. Created a new `ConfirmationDialog` component (`components/admin/ConfirmationDialog.jsx`)
2. Updated `UsersList` to use the confirmation dialog instead of basic `window.confirm()`

**Features of the new confirmation dialog**:
- Professional, accessible UI design
- Different messages for regular users vs pending invitations
- Loading states during deletion
- Proper button styling and hover effects
- Escape key handling and click-outside-to-close

**Dialog Messages**:
- **For regular users**: "Are you sure you want to delete [Name] ([Email])? This action cannot be undone."
- **For pending invitations**: "Are you sure you want to cancel the invitation for [Name] ([Email])?"

### 3. ConfirmationDialog Component (`components/admin/ConfirmationDialog.jsx`)

**Features**:
- Reusable component for other confirmation dialogs
- Configurable title, message, and button text
- Loading states with spinner
- Proper z-index for modal overlay
- Responsive design

**Props**:
- `isOpen`: Controls dialog visibility
- `onConfirm`: Callback for confirmation action
- `onCancel`: Callback for cancellation
- `title`: Dialog title
- `message`: Confirmation message
- `confirmText`: Text for confirm button (default: "Delete")
- `cancelText`: Text for cancel button (default: "Cancel")
- `confirmButtonClass`: CSS classes for confirm button styling
- `isLoading`: Shows loading state during async operations

## Technical Details

### Database Collections Cleaned Up
1. **accounts**: OAuth provider account information
2. **sessions**: User session data
3. **verification_tokens**: Email verification tokens (if any)

### Error Handling
- Graceful degradation: User deletion continues even if collection cleanup fails
- Proper logging for debugging
- Error messages are logged but don't block the deletion process

### User Experience
- Clear, professional confirmation dialog
- Loading states during deletion
- Different messaging for users vs invitations
- Consistent styling with the rest of the application

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Database Cleanup Testing**:
   - Create a test user and verify accounts collection entries are created
   - Delete the user through the admin interface
   - Verify all related collections are cleaned up

2. **Confirmation Dialog Testing**:
   - Test cancellation behavior
   - Test deletion confirmation
   - Test loading states
   - Test with both regular users and pending invitations

3. **Error Handling Testing**:
   - Test deletion with database connection issues
   - Verify graceful degradation when cleanup fails

## Future Improvements

1. **Batch Operations**: Add support for bulk user deletion with confirmation
2. **Audit Trail**: Consider adding deletion logs for administrative purposes
3. **Soft Delete**: Implement soft deletion for better data recovery options
4. **Undo Functionality**: Add temporary undo option for accidental deletions

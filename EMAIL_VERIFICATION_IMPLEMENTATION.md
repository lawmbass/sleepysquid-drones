# Email Verification Implementation

## Overview

This implementation adds comprehensive email verification functionality to the application, including:

1. **Email verification for new users** - Users must verify their email address
2. **Email change verification** - When users change their email, they must verify the new address
3. **Verification status indicator** - Shows "Verified" or "Unverified" status on the settings page
4. **Email verification workflow** - Complete flow for sending and verifying emails

## Features Implemented

### 1. Database Schema Updates

Added new fields to the User model (`models/User.js`):
- `emailVerified`: Boolean indicating if the email is verified (default: false)
- `emailVerificationToken`: Token for initial email verification
- `emailVerificationExpires`: Expiration date for verification token
- `pendingEmail`: New email address pending verification (for email changes)
- `pendingEmailToken`: Token for email change verification
- `pendingEmailExpires`: Expiration date for email change token

### 2. API Endpoints

#### Email Verification APIs:
- `POST /api/user/email/send-verification` - Send verification email to current email
- `POST /api/user/email/verify` - Verify email using token from email link
- `POST /api/user/email/change` - Request email change (sends verification to new email)
- `POST /api/user/email/verify-change` - Verify new email and update user's email address

#### Updated APIs:
- `GET /api/user/settings` - Now includes `emailVerified` and `pendingEmail` status
- `PUT /api/user/settings/profile` - Now prevents direct email changes, requires verification flow

### 3. Verification Pages

#### `/verify-email` - Initial Email Verification
- Handles verification tokens from email links
- Shows loading, success, or error states
- Auto-redirects to dashboard on success

#### `/verify-email-change` - Email Change Verification  
- Handles email change verification tokens
- Updates user's email address on successful verification
- Shows new email address and important login information
- Auto-redirects to settings page

### 4. Settings Page Updates

Enhanced the Settings component (`components/dashboard/Settings.jsx`) with:

#### Email Verification Status
- **Verified**: Shows green checkmark and "Verified" text
- **Unverified**: Shows amber warning icon and "Unverified" text
- **Send Verification** button for unverified emails

#### Email Change Workflow
- **Change Email Address** button to initiate email change
- **Email change form** with new email input
- **Pending email notification** when change is in progress
- **Verification instructions** for users

#### Visual Indicators
- Email field is now read-only (changes must go through verification)
- Color-coded status indicators (green for verified, amber for unverified)
- Informational panels for pending changes and verification status

### 5. Email Templates

Professional HTML email templates for:
- **Initial email verification** with branded styling and clear call-to-action
- **Email change verification** with security warnings and instructions
- **Responsive design** that works across email clients

### 6. Security Features

- **24-hour token expiration** for all verification tokens
- **Secure token generation** using crypto.randomBytes()
- **Email uniqueness validation** prevents duplicate email addresses
- **Middleware protection** for verification endpoints
- **Current email confirmation** required before allowing changes
- **OAuth user auto-verification** - Users who sign up via Google OAuth are automatically marked as verified

## Installation & Setup

### 1. Run Database Migration

After setting up your environment variables, run the migration script:

```bash
npm run migrate:email-verification
```

This script will:
- Add `emailVerified: true` to existing OAuth users (Google sign-in users)
- Add `emailVerified: false` to regular users who signed up via other methods
- Provide statistics on verification status

### 2. Environment Variables

Ensure your `.env` file includes:
```env
MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
NEXTAUTH_URL=your_application_url
MAILGUN_API_KEY=your_mailgun_api_key
```

### 3. Email Configuration

The implementation uses the existing Mailgun configuration from `config.js`. Ensure your Mailgun settings are properly configured.

## User Experience Flow

### OAuth User Sign-up (Google)
1. User signs up via Google OAuth
2. Email is automatically marked as verified (Google has already verified it)
3. User sees "Verified" ✅ status in settings immediately
4. No verification email needed

### Manual User Email Verification
1. User signs up via other methods and receives verification email
2. User clicks verification link in email
3. Verification page processes token and marks email as verified
4. User is redirected to dashboard

### Email Change Flow
1. User goes to Settings → Profile section
2. User sees current email with verification status
3. User clicks "Change Email Address"
4. User enters new email and clicks "Change"
5. Verification email sent to new email address
6. Settings page shows "Email Change Pending" status
7. User clicks verification link in new email
8. Email is updated and marked as verified
9. User must use new email for future logins

## Technical Details

### Token Security
- Tokens are 32-byte cryptographically secure random strings
- Tokens expire after 24 hours
- Used tokens are immediately deleted from database
- Separate token systems for initial verification vs. email changes

### Database Operations
- Atomic updates using MongoDB `$unset` operations
- Proper indexing on email fields for performance
- Audit trail preservation (existing user data remains intact)

### Error Handling
- Comprehensive error messages for expired/invalid tokens
- User-friendly error pages with navigation options
- Graceful fallbacks for missing environment variables
- Development vs. production error detail levels

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements that could be added:
1. **Email verification reminders** - Periodic emails for unverified accounts
2. **Bulk verification management** - Admin tools for managing verification status
3. **Email verification requirements** - Restrict features for unverified users
4. **Two-factor email verification** - Additional security for sensitive changes
5. **Email verification analytics** - Track verification rates and user behavior

## Testing

To test the implementation:

### OAuth User Testing:
1. Sign up using Google OAuth
2. Check that email immediately shows as "Verified" ✅ in settings
3. Confirm no verification email is sent
4. Test email change workflow still works for OAuth users

### Manual User Testing:
1. Create a new user account via other methods (if available)
2. Check that email shows as "Unverified" in settings
3. Click "Send Verification" and check email
4. Verify email using the link
5. Confirm status changes to "Verified"

### Email Change Testing:
1. Test email change workflow with a different email address
2. Verify the new email and confirm the change takes effect
3. Confirm new email shows as verified after successful change

## Support

For issues or questions about the email verification system:
1. Check the server logs for detailed error messages
2. Verify Mailgun configuration and API keys
3. Confirm database connectivity and schema updates
4. Test email delivery in development vs. production environments

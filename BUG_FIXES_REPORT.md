# Bug Fixes Report - Skyview Drone Services

## Overview
This report documents 3 critical bugs found in the codebase, including the admin login issue in production, along with their fixes.

## Bug #1: Admin Login Failure in Production (CRITICAL)

### Problem Description
The admin login system fails in production even when all environment variables are set. Users cannot access the admin dashboard.

### Root Cause Analysis
1. **Missing ADMIN_EMAILS environment variable in .env.example**: The example file doesn't include the ADMIN_EMAILS variable, leading to misconfiguration.
2. **Circular dependency in adminConfig.js**: The adminConfig object references itself in the isAdmin function, causing potential issues.
3. **Session callback async import**: The dynamic import in the session callback may cause timing issues in production.

### Impact
- Complete admin access failure in production
- Security risk as legitimate admins cannot access the system
- Business continuity issues

### Fix Applied
1. Added ADMIN_EMAILS to .env.example
2. Fixed circular dependency in adminConfig.js
3. Improved session callback handling in next-auth.js

## Bug #2: XSS Vulnerability in SEO Component (HIGH SECURITY RISK)

### Problem Description
The `renderSchemaTags()` function in `libs/seo.js` uses `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` without proper sanitization, creating a potential XSS vulnerability.

### Root Cause Analysis
The function directly injects JSON content using `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` without validating or sanitizing the config values that could be manipulated.

### Impact
- Cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks
- Potential code injection
- Data theft and session hijacking

### Fix Applied
Enhanced input validation and sanitization in the SEO component.

## Bug #3: Race Condition in Booking Date Validation (LOGIC ERROR)

### Problem Description
The booking date validation in `pages/api/bookings.js` has a race condition where the date object is modified during validation, causing incorrect validation results.

### Root Cause Analysis
```javascript
// BUGGY CODE:
const bookingDate = new Date(date);
const minDate = new Date();
minDate.setDate(minDate.getDate() + 7);

if (bookingDate < minDate || isNaN(bookingDate.getTime())) {
  // ... validation logic
}

// Later in the code:
const existingBooking = await Booking.findOne({
  email: sanitizedData.email,
  date: {
    $gte: new Date(bookingDate.setHours(0, 0, 0, 0)), // BUG: modifies bookingDate!
    $lt: new Date(bookingDate.setHours(23, 59, 59, 999)) // BUG: uses modified date!
  }
});
```

The `setHours()` method modifies the original `bookingDate` object, causing the second `setHours()` call to work with an already modified date.

### Impact
- Incorrect duplicate booking detection
- Potential booking conflicts
- Data integrity issues

### Fix Applied
Created separate date objects for range queries to prevent mutation.

## Additional Security Improvements
- Enhanced input validation across all endpoints
- Improved error handling to prevent information leakage
- Added proper logging for debugging admin access issues
- Strengthened rate limiting configurations

## Testing Recommendations
1. Test admin login with various email configurations
2. Verify XSS protection with malicious payloads
3. Test booking date validation edge cases
4. Perform penetration testing on admin endpoints

## Files Modified

## Deployment Notes
- Ensure ADMIN_EMAILS environment variable is properly set in production
- Clear any cached sessions after deploying the auth fixes
- Monitor logs for any authentication errors
- Run `node scripts/test-admin-login.js` to verify configuration
- Test admin login functionality thoroughly before deploying to production

## Quick Test Commands
```bash
# Test admin configuration
node scripts/test-admin-login.js your-admin@email.com

# Start development server
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build
```

# Admin Self-Protection Feature Update

## Overview
Added protection to prevent administrators from accidentally modifying their own access status, which would result in error messages and potential confusion.

## Changes Made

### 1. UsersList Component (`/workspace/components/admin/UsersList.jsx`)
- **Mobile Card View**: Disabled access toggle button when user is viewing their own profile
- **Desktop Table View**: Disabled access toggle button when user is viewing their own profile
- **Visual Feedback**: Button appears disabled (opacity-50, cursor-not-allowed) when disabled
- **Tooltip Update**: Shows "Cannot modify your own access status" instead of "Toggle user access"

### 2. UserModal Component (`/workspace/components/admin/UserModal.jsx`)
- **Access Checkbox**: Disabled when user is editing their own profile
- **Visual Feedback**: Checkbox appears disabled with reduced opacity
- **Helper Text**: Shows "Cannot modify your own access status" message below checkbox
- **Styling**: Text color changes to gray when disabled

## Technical Implementation

### Condition Check
```javascript
disabled={user.email === session?.user?.email}
```

This check compares the email of the user being edited with the email of the currently logged-in session user.

### Visual States
- **Enabled**: Normal colors, clickable, standard tooltip
- **Disabled**: 
  - Opacity reduced to 50%
  - Cursor changed to not-allowed
  - Helper text explaining why it's disabled
  - Grayed out text color

## User Experience

### Before
- Admin could click on their own access status
- Would get error message: "Failed to update user. Please try again."
- Confusing user experience

### After
- Button/checkbox is visually disabled
- Clear tooltip/message explaining why it's disabled
- No error messages
- Consistent behavior across mobile and desktop views

## Error Prevention

This change prevents the following error scenario:
1. Admin finds their own user in the user list
2. Admin clicks on their access status toggle
3. API returns error because users cannot modify their own access status
4. User sees confusing error message

Now the UI prevents this interaction from happening in the first place.

## Scope of Protection

This protection applies to:
- ✅ **Access Status Toggle** (Active/Inactive button)
- ✅ **Access Checkbox** in user edit modal
- ❌ **Role Changes** (still allowed - handled separately)
- ❌ **Other Profile Fields** (still allowed - name, email, etc.)

## Related Security Features

This complements the existing server-side protection in `/workspace/pages/api/admin/users/[id].js`:
```javascript
// Prevent admins from modifying their own admin status
if (user.email === session?.user?.email && 'hasAccess' in req.body) {
  return res.status(400).json({
    error: 'Invalid operation',
    message: 'Cannot modify your own access status'
  });
}
```

The UI-level protection prevents users from even attempting the action, while the server-side protection provides security enforcement.

# PR Review Fixes Applied

## Bug #1: Admin Config Ignored, Console Spam Issues ✅ FIXED

**Problem**: The `adminConfig.allowedEmails` property was initialized once but ignored by all methods, causing console spam and making `reloadFromEnv()` ineffective.

**Fix Applied**:
- Added caching mechanism to prevent console spam
- Made `allowedEmails` a getter that uses the cached function
- Fixed `isAdmin()` to use `adminConfig.allowedEmails` instead of direct function call
- Fixed `getAllowedEmails()` and `getConfigInfo()` to use the property
- Enhanced `reloadFromEnv()` to clear cache and force reload
- Added `hasLoggedWarning` flag to prevent repeated console warnings

**Files Modified**: `libs/adminConfig.js`

## Bug #2: Invalid `dotenv` Version Specified ✅ FIXED

**Problem**: The `dotenv` package was specified with version `^17.0.1` which doesn't exist on npm registry.

**Fix Applied**:
- Updated `dotenv` version from `^17.0.1` to `^16.4.5` (latest stable version)

**Files Modified**: `package.json`

## Bug #3: JSON Sanitization Breaks Schema URLs ✅ FIXED

**Problem**: The `sanitizeForJSON` function was escaping `&` to `&amp;` in domain names, breaking URL construction for schema markup.

**Fix Applied**:
- Removed `&` from the characters being escaped in `sanitizeForJSON`
- Updated function comment to clarify it preserves domain names for URLs
- This allows proper URL construction while still preventing XSS through other dangerous characters

**Files Modified**: `libs/seo.js`

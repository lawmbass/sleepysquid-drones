# Security Implementation Guide

This document outlines the security measures implemented in the Sleepy Squid Drones Next.js application.

## 🔐 Security Features Implemented

### 1. Environment Variable Security
- ✅ All sensitive credentials use server-side environment variables (no `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix)
- ✅ MongoDB credentials are never exposed to client-side code
- ✅ API keys are generated using cryptographically secure methods
- ✅ Environment variables are validated on startup

### 2. API Security

#### Rate Limiting
- ✅ **Booking API**: 5 requests per 15 minutes per IP
- ✅ **Admin API**: 50 requests per 5 minutes per IP
- ✅ **General API**: 100 requests per 15 minutes per IP

#### Authentication & Authorization
- ✅ Admin endpoints require Bearer token authentication
- ✅ API key validation with secure comparison
- ✅ Environment variable validation for security configs

#### Input Validation & Sanitization
- ✅ Server-side input validation for all fields
- ✅ XSS prevention through HTML tag removal
- ✅ Email format validation with regex
- ✅ Phone number format validation
- ✅ Service type whitelist validation
- ✅ Date validation (minimum 7 days advance)

### 3. Database Security

#### MongoDB Best Practices
- ✅ Connection string stored in environment variables
- ✅ Mongoose schema validation with error messages
- ✅ Database indexes for performance and duplicate prevention
- ✅ IP address and user agent tracking for audit trails

#### Data Protection
- ✅ Duplicate booking prevention
- ✅ Field length limits to prevent DoS attacks
- ✅ Enum validation for status and service types

### 4. HTTP Security Headers

#### Next.js Middleware
- ✅ `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`
- ✅ `X-Frame-Options: DENY`
- ✅ `X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block`
- ✅ `Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin`
- ✅ `Content-Security-Policy` implementation
- ✅ API route caching prevention

### 5. Error Handling
- ✅ Generic error messages (no sensitive data exposure)
- ✅ Detailed logging for debugging (server-side only)
- ✅ Proper HTTP status codes
- ✅ Validation error aggregation

## 🛡️ Usage Instructions

### Admin API Access
To access admin endpoints, include the authorization header:

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer sk_admin_697f7e774b10d9c0d22bf9ce0d6eaa3117b559a60873dbad62e7f28448319345" \
     https://yourdomain.com/api/admin/bookings
```

### Environment Setup
1. Copy the `.env` file and update with your actual credentials
2. Ensure `.env` is in your `.gitignore` file
3. Never commit real API keys to version control

### Security Testing
Run the API key generator to create new secure keys:
```bash
node scripts/generateApiKey.js
```

## 🚨 Security Checklist

- [ ] Update default passwords and API keys
- [ ] Enable HTTPS in production
- [ ] Configure MongoDB Atlas with IP whitelisting
- [ ] Set up monitoring and alerting
- [ ] Regular security audits (`npm audit`)
- [ ] Implement proper logging and monitoring
- [ ] Consider implementing 2FA for admin access
- [ ] Regular backups with encryption

## 📝 Additional Recommendations

### Production Security
1. **HTTPS Only**: Ensure all traffic uses HTTPS
2. **Database Security**: Use MongoDB Atlas with network restrictions
3. **Monitoring**: Implement logging and monitoring solutions
4. **Backups**: Regular encrypted backups
5. **Updates**: Keep dependencies updated

### Advanced Security
1. **WAF**: Consider using a Web Application Firewall
2. **DDoS Protection**: Implement DDoS protection (Cloudflare, etc.)
3. **Security Headers**: Additional headers via CDN/proxy
4. **Intrusion Detection**: Monitor for suspicious activities

  - Status indicators with colored dots for quick visual reference
  - Personalized welcome message
  - All information accessible without scrolling

### 2. Client Dashboard (ClientContent.jsx)
- **Before**: Three separate large cards for stats
- **After**:
  - Compact welcome header
  - 3-column grid showing Active Jobs, Completed Jobs, and Assets
  - Quick action buttons for common tasks

  - **BookingsList**: Card-based layout replacing table on mobile
    - Each booking in a compact card with organized information sections
    - Customer name, status, service, and date prominently displayed
    - Contact info, location, and pricing in condensed format

## Benefits
